# libcrails-databases

Basis for all the database backends in libcrails. This database module allows
you to declare configurations for each of your database, depending on the
environment.

You may use the `CRAILS_DATABASE` macro to create a connection to each of your
configured database from anywhere in your application.

You can also connect to an unconfigured database by using the `CRAILS_DATABASE_FROM_SETTINGS`
macro.
